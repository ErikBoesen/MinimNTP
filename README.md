# MinimNTP IS OBSOLETE!
I have stopped updating this extension. Instead of it, I recommend:
* My other new tab page, [BWNT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doiinciigjmmlnbehjjjkeoamihggkba). It's similar to this page, except it has no background photos, just solid colors. Personally, I like it better.
* If you like the feel of MinimNTP, you can check out [Embark New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/embark-new-tab-page/aeajehgeohhgjbhhbicilpenjfcbfnpg) by James Moss. It's very similar.

Thank you for using MinimNTP.
